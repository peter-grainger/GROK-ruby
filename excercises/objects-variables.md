# Classes Objects and Variables

## Key Concepts

- Ruby is a true object orientated language, everything in Ruby is an object, there are no primitives, all numbers / characters / booleans inherit from Object and have and object ID

- Ruby is loosely typed you can not declare a variables type

## Variables

You can not set the scope or the type.  i.e. `const` or `String`

```ruby
foo = "bar" # => "bar"
```

### Variable Example

```bash
$ ruby examples/variables.rb
"bar"
```

## Objects

A number, boolean and string are all objects in Ruby

```ruby
"bar".class # => String
3.class # => Integer
false.class # => FalseClass
```

The above is shorthand syntax for creating the object and initializing it with a value.  The string object provides a constructor which is an ali

```ruby
String.new("bar") # => "bar"
"bar" # => "bar"
```

When assigning an object to a variable the variable holds a reference to the object.  It does not create a new object with the same value

```ruby
a = "foo"
a.object_id # => 70237022091420
b = a
b.object_id # => 70237022091420
b = a.clone
b.object_id # => 70237001505260 It's different!!!
```

Note that the `.clone` method is a shallow copy, nested references **do not** get copied as values then get copied as references

Each object created inherits a large amount of library methods.  The official API documentation: <https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.3/>.

### Objects Example

```bash
$ ruby examples/objects.rb
String
Integer
FalseClass
String
...
```

## Challenge üé†

Use Rspec to run the challenges

```bash
bin/rspec spec/challenges/objects-variables_spec.rb --format doc
```

fix [./challenges/objects-variables.rb](./challenges/object-variables.rb) so the tests pass ‚úîÔ∏è
