# Blocks (and lambdas)

Blocks and lamdbas are discrete pieces of code that aren't attached to an object or method.

## Yield

To run a block use the keyword `yield`.  This runs the implicit block defined within the curly braces `{}`.  This implicit block is anonomous and **can't be assigned to a variable**

Convert an implicit block to an explicit block using the `&` operator.  This converts it to a `Proc` object which has the `send` method to execute the block and a name assigned to it to pass around

```ruby
file://lib/examples/block_yield.rb
```

The number argument is passed in the normal way in brackets `(2)` the block is passed by adding it **after** the method `execute_block(number) {|number| number + 1}`
 
```ruby
file://spec/examples/block_yield_spec.rb
```

What if a block isn't defined by accident?  Ruby has a way to guard against this with the special method `block_given?` which checks if a block has been passed.

```ruby
file://lib/examples/block_check.rb
```

If the method call doesn't include the block the action doesn't take place.

```ruby
file://spec/examples/block_check.rb
```

## Block local variables

Rubyism:

- Block arguments shadow variables in outer scope
- Variables defined in the block don't shadow, they overwrite!

In this example the block executed in the middle of the method increment_by_one defines the variable `current_number` this overwrites the variable defined in the scope also called `current number` which is probably not as intended.

```ruby
def execute_block(number)
    yield number
end

def increment_by_one(number)
    current_number = 7
    new_number = execute_block(number) { |number|
        current_number = number + 1
        current_number
    }
    "current number: #{current_number} new number: #{new_number} original number #{number}"
    # current number: 2!               new number: 2             original number 1
end
```

To fix this use a block local variable.  Define using `;` then the name of the variable.

```ruby
new_number = execute_block(number) { |number; current_number|
    # ...
}
```

### block variable example

```bash
$ ruby examples/block-local-variables.rb
current number: 2 new number: 2 original number 1
current number: 7 new number: 2 original number 1
```

### Lambdas

Lambdas are pretty much the same as procs with some key differences:

- lambdas are strict about amount of arguments
- `return` executed in outer scope for proc (so don't use)
- `break` isn't allowed outside a loop in a proc
- lambda only `break`'s or `return`'s out of that lambda to the outer scope

Prefer Lambdas over Procs as they are less error prone.  The following example shows how a break can have unintended side effects.

```bash
file://lib/examples/lambdas.rb
```
