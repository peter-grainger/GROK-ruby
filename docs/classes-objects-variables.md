# Classes Objects and Variables

## Key Concepts

- Ruby is a true object orientated language, everything in Ruby is an object, there are no primitives, all numbers / characters / booleans inherit from Object and have and object ID

- Ruby is loosely typed you can not declare what type of object a variable is.

## Variables

Ruby doesn't declare a keyword before declaring a variable

[variables.rb](../examples/variables.rb)

```ruby
foo = "bar" # => "bar"
```
